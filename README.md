## Installation
1. Download the zip for the [latest release](https://github.com/nathanielw/Bootstrap-Pencil-Stencils/releases/latest). (Make sure you grab the _bootstrap-pencil-stencils-vx.x.x.zip_ file, **not** the source code zip).
2. In Pencil, install the .zip via _Tools_ > _Install new collection..._

### Updating
Right-click on the collection in Pencil's sidebar and choose _Uninstall this collection_ before repeating the installation steps.

## Notes
A lot of the elements provide variations which can be accessed by right-clicking on the element once it's on the canvas.
